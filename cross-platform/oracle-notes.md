# Oracle Design Notes

## Strengths
- Mature constraint deferral
- Strong transactional guarantees
- Widely accepted in audit-heavy environments

## Trade-Offs
- No native partial indexes
- Function-based indexing requires care

Oracle enforces the same business rules
with enterprise-grade guarantees.
