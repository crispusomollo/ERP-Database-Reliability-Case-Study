# Core Business Integrity Rules

The following rules apply regardless of database engine:

1. An asset may have only one active assignment at a time
2. Approved workflow records must have approval history
3. Partial transactional updates are not permitted
4. Integrity violations must fail early and visibly

Each platform enforces these rules using its native strengths.
