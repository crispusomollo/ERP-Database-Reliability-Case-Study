# Rollback Guidelines

Rollback is a controlled response, not failure.

---

## When to Roll Back

- Preventive controls block legitimate operations
- Unexpected performance degradation occurs
- Business workflows are incorrectly constrained

---

## Rollback Rules

- Roll back enforcement, not data
- Remove one control at a time
- Re-run detection queries after rollback
- Document rollback and root cause

---

## Principle

> Rollback restores flexibility, not correctness.
