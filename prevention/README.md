# Prevention – Constraints and Enforcement

This directory contains database-level enforcement patterns
designed to prevent known ERP integrity violations.

Prevention rules:
- Enforce business invariants at the data layer
- Eliminate reliance on application sequencing
- Fail early and visibly
- Prefer declarative constraints over procedural logic

Prevention is the final outcome of incident learning.
