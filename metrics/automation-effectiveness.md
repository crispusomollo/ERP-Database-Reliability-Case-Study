Automation quality is measured by signal accuracy,
not alert volume.

|------|--------|--------|
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | < 5 min | < 5 min |
| Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) | < 30 min | < 30 min |

## Interpretation

Automation is trusted because:
- Alerts are rare
- Alerts are actionable
- Alerts always have owners
