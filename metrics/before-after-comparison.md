# Before vs After — Control Effectiveness

This comparison highlights system behavior before and after
the introduction of database-level enforcement and automation.

---

## Integrity Enforcement

| Area | Before | After |
|----|-------|------|
| Asset custody uniqueness | Application logic only | Database-enforced |
| Approval audit completeness | Best-effort | Guaranteed |
| Invalid state prevention | Not enforced | Impossible |
| Dependency on manual checks | High | Minimal |

---

## Detection Capability

| Metric | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) | Days | < 5 minutes |
| Detection method | Manual reconciliation | Automated |
| Silent failure risk | High | Eliminated |

---

## Recovery & Stability

| Metric | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) | Hours | < 30 minutes |
| Recovery predictability | Ad-hoc | Scripted |
| Rollback readiness | Undefined | Documented |

---

## Summary

The system moved from **reactive correction**
to **preventive enforcement with continuous assurance**.
