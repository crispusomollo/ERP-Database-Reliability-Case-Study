# Failure Modes Analysis

This directory documents known and plausible failure scenarios
for the ERP data integrity lifecycle.

The objective is to:
- Anticipate failure before it occurs
- Define detection and response paths
- Assign ownership and residual risk
- Support governance, audit, and risk review

Failure modes are reviewed annually or after material incidents.
