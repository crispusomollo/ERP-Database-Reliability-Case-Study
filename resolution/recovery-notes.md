# Recovery Principles

Recovery scripts exist to correct data,
not to mask problems.

Principles:
- Always validate before recovery
- Always run inside a transaction
- Never delete historical data
- Always verify after recovery
- Always follow recovery with prevention

Recovery is a controlled exception,
not a routine operation.
